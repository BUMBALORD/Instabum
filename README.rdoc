A Rails recreation of Instagram, built mostly as a chance to implement the Devise gem at the inception of an app and to use the paperclip gem.

The views are written primarily in Haml, as I wanted to get a chance to learn the syntax.

Still in progress, but if you wish to use the app simply clone and run "bundle install"
